# SOC-Automation-Project

## Objective

The SOC Automation project is aimed to create a Home-Lab with responsive capabilites and a case management system to mimic a real soft environment.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Graph drawing software (draw.io) to build a logical diagram.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps

<b>Part 1: Create a diagram (to map out how to build lab logically).</b>

<b>Part 2: Installing Windows 10 Server w/Sysmon, Wazuh Server, and TheHive Server.</b>

- Software and Tools needed: A Virtual Machine (VM), Windows 10 identical storage image (iso) file, and Cloud servers (digital ocean).
- VM operating system settings: 50GB of storage and 4GB of RAM.

First, download [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) from the Microsoft site and the sysmon-modular configuration file [sysmonconfig.xml](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular) from github.


<b>Part 3: Configuring TheHive & Wazuh Server.</b>
