# SOC-Automation-Project

## Objective

The SOC Automation project is aimed to create a Home-Lab with responsive capabilites and a case management system to mimic a real soft environment.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Graph drawing software (draw.io) to build a logical diagram.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps

Part 1: Create a diagram (to map out how to build lab logically).

Part 2: Installing Windows 10 Server w/Sysmon, Wazuh Server, and TheHive Server.

Part 3: Configuring TheHive & Wazuh Server.
